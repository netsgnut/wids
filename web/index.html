        Twitter's Network Digest are highly personalized emails that go to users and show them the best
        tweets from their network that they missed on Twitter.  There's multiple systems involved in both
        figuring out what the best tweets for any given user is (all 200+ million of them) and then in

        In the four years since Square was started, it has grown from the a small team of 3 people to almost 500.
        A software project that was written on a couch to a large company used by millions on a daily basis.
        I was part of the founding team of Square, joining before anyone had written about it in the news and
        before any venture capital had been invested.
      </p>
      <p>
        Square mission is the simplify the interaction between a customer and a merchant. Something most of us do
        multiple times a day. This process is fraught with tedium, legislation, and often results in filling your
        pocket with unwanted scraps of papers. But before Square existed, most people did not give it a second thought.
      </p>
      <p>
        Square solved this by offering a low cost, simple, point of sale system which many believe was technically
        impossible and unlikely to succeed. Many product and technical decisions along the way allowed Square to
        launch, gain traction, and become a company worth billions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Learn about the early days of Square. What we thought while we were just getting started and how the product
        changed even before the public was able to use it.

        No longer a vision, cloud computing is transforming business and information technology. For application
        developers, this means new approaches for delivering applications and services to potentially hundreds
        of millions of users.  From development, testing, storage, media services, mobile services, data management,
        messaging, application integration, cloud services and big data, cloud computing is changing the way developers
        build, run and manage applications.  Join us for this session to a look at Windows Azure, Microsoft's
        application platform for the public cloud, and hear about how developers from around the world are benefiting
        from this new approach for delivering applications and services using .NET, Java, PHP, Python, Node.js, Ruby
        as well as SUSE, ubuntu and OpenLogic Linux distributions.

        The performance and the lack of development resources have always been the most doubtful
        facts of running demanding 3D games on the web. The wish to build a 3D game engine and to
        run commercial 3D games on the web take enormous time &amp; money. Hence the technologies that
        can bridge the web and the existing native libraries/applications become more desirable.
        In this talk, a platform that solve this issue to bridge the gap between web and native
        will be introduced. This platform is comprised of technologies that are either standard-based
        or aiming at standards which will allow those high-end 3D games to be distributed
        more easily and more cost-effectively than ever.

        The world of software developers around the globe is increasingly mobile. At the same time
        teams are feeling more and more pressure to deliver fast. Luckily, the recent evolutions in
        technology have also spurred a number of technologies that help those teams keep up with the
        pace. In this presentation mixed with live demonstrations, we'll look at a number of prototyping
        tools, developer productivity tools, test automation tools, cross-platform development tools,
        and infrastructure services that are proving to be at the core of agility in this cloud era
        we're living in.

        Since the launch of Google Maps in 2005, we have been enjoying the convenience brought
        by the map. With the StreetView function launched, we can even browse the world without
        stepping outside. The Google Maps API has been launched for developers to leverage the
        beauty of Google Maps and put it in different applications. The instructor will first give
        a brief introduction to Google Maps history and features. He will also talk about the
        principles of the Google Maps API and compare the differences between versions. Students
        shall have hands-on exercise to overlay their own floor plans and StreetView imagery with
        the help of the Google Maps API. The instructor will also give tips and tricks while using
        the Google Maps API.
